# WebGL Simulator
A basic structure of WebGL simulator. Using this, one can create any type of online game and simulator.

## Run
- Make a simple HTTP server in code directory
- Request `index.html` by any browser

## Features
- Base structure for making any simulator of game in WebGL
- Asynchronous loading of graphics models in WebGL
- Parser for `.obj` files
- Applying textures to models
- Movement of models
- Lighting and Shading using vertex and fragment shaders
- Taking input by mouse and keyboard events

## Scope of Improvement
- Making a finely working simulator using this base structure
- Improvement in Shading and Lighting in vertex and fragment shaders
